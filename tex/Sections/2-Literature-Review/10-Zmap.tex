\label{s:HowZmapWorks}
In 2013 the Zmap project was developed, a network scanner designed to scan the whole IPv4 address space from one single host. It is capable of doing so within 45 minutes.
Compared to Nmap, Zmap is capable of scanning the whole IPv4 public address space 1300 times faster \autocite{durumeric2013zmap}.
