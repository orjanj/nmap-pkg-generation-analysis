\subsection{Port scan and service scanning}
\label{s:PortScanning}
\label{s:ServiceScan}

By conducting port scanning, information about running services and open ports could be retrieved.
This could further be used to determine misconfiguration on a system or version of the software which could be mapped against known exploitable vulnerabilities. It exists multiple types of port scanning methods, further elaborated below \autocite{pinkard2008nmap}. Port scanning is a reconnaissance technique used to discover services running on open ports which could be exploited to gain access to a system. Port scanning is primarily divided into vertically and horizontally scans, further elaborated in section \ref{s:HorizontalScanning}. In vertical attacks, described in section \ref{s:VerticalScanning}, multiple ports are scanned on one host. This is a common process when a threat actor is interested in one specific host to attack \autocite{dabbagh2011slow}.
