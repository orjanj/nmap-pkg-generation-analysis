\section{Theory behind network scanners and exploration of scanning methods} % TODO: Review title!
\label{s:HowToScanning}

Network scanning is a reconnaissance activity conducted within the field of network intrusion \autocite{TaxonomyOfNetworkScanning}. During an intelligence-gathering step, network scanning is one of the first steps before an attack is about to happen \autocite{HOUMZ2021103230}.
Conducting a network scan would reveal information about hosts on a network, which includes running services and applications, open ports, and operating system details. The main techniques applied during network scanning are version and service detection, scanning ports, operating system detection, and network mapping \autocite{pinkard2008nmap}. During a network scan devices and services vulnerable for attacks could be unveiled \autocite{HOUMZ2021103230}.
