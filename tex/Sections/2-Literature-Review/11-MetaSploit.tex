The Metaspolit framework\footnote{\OrjansHref{https://www.metasploit.com}{https://www.metasploit.com}} is a open source penetration testing framework with a large database of tested exploits, currently one of the biggest open-source projects within penetration testing and information security. Within the framework it exists a enormous database with exploits and vulnerability assessment which allows an pentester to compromise the system security where vulnerabilities exists within the network stack, operating system or services. Other useful features is payload which is the running code doing the work after it's conducted the exploitation on a system. This could be traffic to conduct command and control (C2) to establish a connection between the remote host and an threat actor. Metasploit are designed in a way to easily integrate new exploit code to the framework since the modules of the complete system are small building blocks \autocite{MetasploitBook}.
