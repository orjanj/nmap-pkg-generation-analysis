Unicornscan has the capabilities of conducting port scanning, which works as an asynchronous scanner. It's able to gather information quickly and uses distributed TCP/IP stack for fast responses \autocite{hoque2014network}. Unicornscan has also capabilities for banner grabbing, port scanning, logging, and identification of operating systems and applications \autocite{UnicornScan}.
