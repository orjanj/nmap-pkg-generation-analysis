\section{Horizontal and vertical scanning}
\label{s:HorizontalScanning}
A horizontal scan sends probes to each host connected to the Internet connectable outside the firewall \autocite{leonard2012stochastic}. This could also be conducted on a local network. During a horizontal scan, one single port are targeted on multiple hosts. The most use case of this scanning method is to identify vulnerabilities for a service running on a specific port \autocite{TaxonomyOfNetworkScanning}.

\label{s:VerticalScanning}
Vertical scanning sends probes on various ports against one specific host on the network \autocite{TaxonomyOfNetworkScanning}.
If a known vulnerability is out and a user using a scanner are interested to know how many or who are using the explicit version of a software, a vertical scan could be conducted to map this out.
