\section{Scanning activity towards others networks}
\label{s:ScanOtherNetworks}
Today organizations exist and offer services providing data sets generated out of Internet scanning. Two of the largest organizations offering this are Censys\footnote{\OrjansHref{https://censys.io}{https://censys.io}} and Shodan\footnote{\OrjansHref{https://www.shodan.io}{https://www.shodan.io}}. These two organizations provide a search engine-like interface to their datasets and operate on a subscription-based model. There search engines index large databases of the results of their scanning activities of networks and devices connected to the Internet.
Shodan is a widely known search engine finding devices connected to the Internet.
It can provide a specific version of a software (e.g. Apache version $x$) running on a host connected to the internet. Shodan gathers banners containing versioning information, identifying a given host with a given IP address together with version of software running \autocite{ShodanGuide}.
