\section{Autonomous scanning activity by malware}
\label{s:AutonomousScanning}
After multiple large attacks at the end of 2016, the Mirai botnet got known. Mirai spreads through scanning a large set of IP addresses across the Internet, looking for vulnerable devices to exploit \autocite{10.5555/3241189.3241275}. It then tries to gain control of the device by applying default credentials. This continues until the network contains controllable devices that are set up successfully. Mirai communicates to a command and control server where the malware is deployed to the host and then further spread out \autocite{MiraiPracticalAnalysis}.
This shows that the Mirai botnet initially uses autonomous scans to find exploitable hosts to deploy its malware too.
