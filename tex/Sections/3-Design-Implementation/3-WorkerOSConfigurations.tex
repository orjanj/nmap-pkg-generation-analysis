\section{Worker operating system configurations}
\label{s:WorkerOSConfiguration}
During the installation and initial setup of a worker, multiple configuration changes need to be applied in order to decrease the amount of noise traffic.
This noise traffic is primarily generated by the Ubuntu Linux packet managers APT and Snap, further elaborated in the section \ref{ss:DisableSnapAPT}.
Another noise generator is the network time protocol, described in section \ref{ss:DisableNTP}.
The use of these packet managers and an updated time through NTP is not relevant to use during this research and are therefore disabled.
