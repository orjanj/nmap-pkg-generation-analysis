\section{Lab Environment}
A segmented lab environment was needed in order to accomplish the objectives of generating synthetic scanning data for comparison.
Within this chapter, the design choices and implementation details are elaborated.
Chosen virtualization platform is VMware Workstation in combination with the operating systems Ubuntu Server for scanning targets and Kali Linux for the scanning host.
A guide for installation of Kali Linux can be followed on the official Kali web page \footnote{\OrjansHref{https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/}{https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/}}.
