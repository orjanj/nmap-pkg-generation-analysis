\subsection{Lab environment}

Through an initiation worker preparation script, there are implemented commands to reduce traffic noise affecting the scan results. This script disables certain services known for querying servers on the internet for the purpose of updating time through NTP, automatic operating system updates, and operating system package updates. This script must be run during the setup of the environment to ensure noise reduction. Another very important step during this initial configuration is change moving the tcpdump command to suid ($chmod +s$), meaning a regular user is able to run tcpdump as a regular user. The command must be executed by root. During the initial configuration of each worker, the SSH public key for the scanner host is added to the worker's authorized keys in $\$HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys$. It allows the scanner host to remotely access each worker with the use of its SSH private key to manage tasks for the worker through SSH. Each worker has its own $bscadm$ local user for this purpose. SSH listens only to the management network interface on each worker.
