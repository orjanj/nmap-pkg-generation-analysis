The main objective is the creation of a framework for synthetic packet generation and characterization of Nmap scans.
Together with the main objectives for the research is the problem statement and scope and limitations described within chapter \ref{chp:Introduction}.
Required for these objectives are the design and implementation of a local lab environment, further described in chapter \ref{chp:DesignImplementation}, including the necessary tools for conducting data generation and task management.
To achieve the goals of conducting empirical analysis, the development of an analysis template is further described within chapter \ref{chp:DataAnalysis}, together with the generation, processing, and analysis of data.
The actual results of the analysis conducted are presented in chapter \ref{chp:Results}.
