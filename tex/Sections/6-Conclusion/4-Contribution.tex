\section{Research Contribution}
\label{s:ResearchContribution}
This thesis presents a framework for synthetic packet generation using Nmap and an analysis of the captured data.
The produced artifacts and expected outputs of this research are the developed tools for conducting data generation, processing, and analysis found in \ref{app:ElectronicResources}.
These tools enable other researchers to conduct synthetic packet generation together with analysis of the data outcome.
By automating this process conducted within this thesis, researchers are able to scope up the generation of data, not only limiting these scans to a number of 10 scans as in this thesis.
Useful areas for this framework and other use cases are presented in section \ref{s:ConclusionFutureWork}.
