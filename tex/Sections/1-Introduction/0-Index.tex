This research report elaborates on the automatic generation of synthetic network scanning packet captures using various types of scan modes and templates using the Nmap scanner. By generating synthetic data sets, where the control of the tasks conducted against each worker host running packet capturing, the analysis of these data sets could be used in a comparative analysis to classify and detect various types of network scans. Following this method elaborated in the paper would allow synthetic data generation for use in a comparative analysis.

The main objective of this research is to automate network scans in order to generate synthetic data sets, which in the future would optimize the method of collecting quality data for analysis purposes.
The research outcome is expected to generate data sets containing synthetic data, which would be used as a step in the preparation process of signatures as a final research output.
