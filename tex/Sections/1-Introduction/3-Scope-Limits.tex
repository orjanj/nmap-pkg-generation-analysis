\section{Scope and Limits}
\label{s:ScopeLimits}

In this thesis the scope and limitations are limited to the network scanner called Nmap.
Within the research the limitations are set for using six scanning types in Nmap:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Connect scan - discussed in section \ref{s:ConnectScan}
    \item Fin scan - discussed in section \ref{s:FINScan}
    \item Null scan - discussed in section \ref{s:NullScan}
    \item Ping scan - discussed in section \ref{s:ICMPEcho}
    \item Service scan - discussed in section \ref{s:ServiceScan}
    \item Xmas scan - discussed in section \ref{s:XMASScan}
\end{itemize}



There are no restrictions regarding timing templates since this research evaluates all six Nmap timing templates.
Time constraints are a significant limitation regarding the scope of this research which involves a risk to the quality of the research outcome.
Another limit and risk is the lack of previous exact similar research to examine.
The research is limited to one local virtual lab environment not connected to the cloud, which requires a local hands-on appearance.
Ethical issues and risks regarding port scanning are mitigated by conducting the research in a local closed lab environment.
Finally, limitations and risks for data loss due to hardware crashes are a factor in the research. This is mitigated through regular backups to external hosts.
