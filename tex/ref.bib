this, it's classification remains vague and detection systems in current Network Intrusion

presents a classification of network scanning and illustrates how complex and varied
this activity is. The presented classification extends previous, well known, definitions
of scanning traffic in a manner which reflects this complexity.},

	abstract = {Internet traffic is neither well-behaved nor well-understood, which makes it difficult to detect malicious activities such as scanning. A large portion of scanning activity is of a slow scan type and is not currently detectable by security appliances. In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78\% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80\% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan. The data is stored in an efficient manner, allowing activity information to be retained for very long periods of time. This technique provides insight into Internet traffic by classifying known activities, giving visibility to threats to the network through scan detection, while also extending awareness of the activities occurring on the network.},

abstract = {Network scanning is one of the first steps in gathering information about a target before launching attacks. It is used to scan for vulnerable devices and exposed services in order to exploit them. Such exploits can result in data breaches or network disruption, which can be very costly for organizations. There are many factors, including technical and non-technical, affecting the volume of scanning activities. In this paper, we study the impact of vulnerability disclosure on the volume of scans over time and propose a machine learning-based approach to predict this impact. We conducted a comprehensive data collection of network scans from two network telescopes hosted in different countries, as well as the disclosed vulnerabilities from 2014 to 2019. We then designed a set of features to characterize the disclosed vulnerabilities and used several classifiers to predict whether a vulnerability will impact the volume of daily scans. The resulting classifier achieves over 85\% accuracy in predicting the impact. In addition, we performed an analysis of the key characteristics of vulnerabilities that directly affect scanning activities. Our findings show that this approach is able to classify vulnerabilities that have an impact on network scans. The implementation of our model and validation tests proved the efficiency of the selected features, as well as the robustness of our model to classify vulnerabilities’ impact on scans.}

In this paper, we provide a seven-month retrospective analysis of Mirai's growth to a peak of 600k infections and a history of its DDoS victims. By combining a variety of measurement perspectives, we analyze how the botnet emerged, what classes of devices were affected, and how Mirai variants evolved and competed for vulnerable hosts. Our measurements serve as a lens into the fragile ecosystem of IoT devices. We argue that Mirai may represent a sea change in the evolutionary development of botnets--the simplicity through which devices were infected and its precipitous growth, demonstrate that novice malicious techniques can compromise enough low-end devices to threaten even some of the best-defended targets. To address this risk, we recommend technical and nontechnical interventions, as well as propose future research directions.},

ABSTRACT = {Threat assessment is the continuous process of monitoring the threats identified in the network of the real-time informational environment of an organisation and the business of the companies. The sagacity and security assurance for the system of an organisation and company’s business seem to need that information security exercise to unambiguously and effectively handle the threat agent’s attacks. How is this unambiguous and effective way in the present-day state of information security practice working? Given the prevalence of threats in the modern information environment, it is essential to guarantee the security of national information infrastructure. However, the existing models and methodology are not addressing the attributes of threats like motivation, opportunity, and capability (C, M, O), and the critical threat intelligence (CTI) feed to the threat agents during the penetration process is ineffective, due to which security assurance arises for an organisation and the business of companies. This paper proposes a semi-automatic information security model, which can deal with situational awareness data, strategies prevailing information security activities, and protocols monitoring specific types of the network next to the real-time information environment. This paper looks over analyses and implements the threat assessment of network traffic in one particular real-time informational environment. To achieve this, we determined various unique attributes of threat agents from the Packet Capture Application Programming Interface (PCAP files/DataStream) collected from the network between the years 2012 and 2019. We used hypothetical and real-world examples of a threat agent to evaluate the three different factors of threat agents, i.e., Motivation, Opportunity, and Capability (M, O, C). Based on this, we also designed and determined the threat profiles, critical threat intelligence (CTI), and complexity of threat agents that are not addressed or covered in the existing threat agent taxonomies models and methodologies.},

abstract = {Nmap Network Scanning is the official guide to the Nmap Security Scanner, a free and open source utility used by millions of people for network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on the wire. Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems, optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing, detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Nmap's original author, Gordon "Fyodor" Lyon, wrote this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning during more than 11 years of Nmap development.
