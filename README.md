# Nmap Package Generation and Analysis
## What is this?
A framework for generating synthetic packet captures and characterization of Nmap scans.

This is developed as my bachelors degree in Cyber Security at [Noroff](https://www.noroff.no).

Within this repository scripts for conducting scanning, maintaining tasks and other useful scripts for conducting research.
