# Nmap Package Generation and Analysis
## What is this?
A proof-of-concept framework for generating synthetic packet captures and characterization of Nmap scans.

Within this repository scripts for conducting scanning, maintaining tasks and other useful scripts for conducting research.

## Why is this made?
This is developed as my bachelors degree in Cyber Security at [Noroff](https://www.noroff.no).

The Kanban board used for project management during development is located [here](https://github.com/users/orjanj/projects/3).

The research paper would be located within this repository in a later stage.
